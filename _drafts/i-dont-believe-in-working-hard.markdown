Imagine you give someone the task to dig two holes in the floor, both 2 meters by two meters, so you hire two people, one for one hole, one for the other.

You ask them how long they think it will take, Guy#1 estimates it will take him two weeks and asks for 1200€(80 hours at 15€/hour), Guy#2 estimates 3 hours and asks for 600€(200€/hour).

Guy#1 used a spoon do dig his hole, he worked 40 hours per week for two weeks, got dirty and tired, he worked very hard.

Guy#2 used an excavator, he used a tool that abstracted him from the work, which allowed him to work faster, it came with extra costs, but it was still faster.

Does Guy#1 deserve more money because he worked harder, due to using the wrong tool for the job, and not being prepared?
