So, you decided to start doing web development, prepare yourself for an interesting adventure.

I'm assuming that if you are here, you have basic knowledge and can already build a web page and use most of the languages I talk about here, or at least know what each one is for.

## What kind of developer are you?

Decide whether you like front or back end development more, frontend developers will focus on user interfaces, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and javascript(this can also be used on the server, more on that later). And backend developers will focus on things like data manipulation, password hashing, and algorithms, using languages like PHP, Python, Java, and Javascript(Nodejs).

If you can't decide which one you like the most, then you can call yourself a full-stack developer. However, keep in mind that many companies will rather hire someone very specialized in either front or backend, and everyone has their strongest side.

### Frontend

Starting with CSS, learn about preprocessors, Task runners

My favourite resources for frontend:
- [CSS](https://css-tricks.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript){:target="_blank"}
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5){:target="_blank"}

### Backend

Profiling, measuring performance

## It's not all about technical skills

Many people think of developers as anti-social creatures that feel most comfortable behind a screen, even developers think that of themselves, however, you will be dealing with people whether you want to or not, and people skills will make the most difference in what jobs you get and how long you keep them.
