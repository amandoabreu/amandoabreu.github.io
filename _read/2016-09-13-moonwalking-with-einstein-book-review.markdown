## Moonwalking With Einstein Book Review

How can someone memorize a string of 1000 random digits in one hour, and recite them perfectly? Or the order of 2 shuffled decks of cards in less than 2 minutes? Or what even IS a memory? Do they have out of the ordinary brains, or are they using techniques that anyone can learn?

This book shows you those techniques, you don't need an extraordinary brain, even if you forget your car keys or why you opened the refrigerator, you could train your mind to remember huge amounts of information faster than the typical techniques, and longer lasting.

The "ars memorativa" or "art of memory" are a set of rules
