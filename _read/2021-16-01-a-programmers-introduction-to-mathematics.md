A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics uses your familiarity with ideas from programming and software to teach mathematics. You'll learn about the central objects and theorems of mathematics, including graphs, calculus, linear algebra, eigenvalues, optimization, and more. You'll also be immersed in the often unspoken cultural attitudes of mathematics, learning both how to read and write proofs while understanding why mathematics is the way it is. Between each technical chapter is an essay describing a different aspect of mathematical culture, and discussions of the insights and meta-insights that constitute mathematical intuition. As you learn, we'll use new mathematical ideas to create wondrous programs, from cryptographic schemes to neural networks to hyperbolic tessellations. Each chapter also contains a set of exercises that have you actively explore mathematical topics on your own. In short, this book will teach you to engage with mathematics.

#### Expectations for reading A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics

I wasn't the best in mathematics at school. But on my spare time I was teaching myself how to write code and some basic algorithms. I ever made the connection that a program was very similar to a proof until I took the Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning. 

**It suddenly hit me that Î£ was basically a "for loop".** And I couldn't help but wonder what other parallels there were. I looked around for a book and one didn't exist, but this one came out soon after I started wondering about it.

The point for reading this book is to not get completely lost when the mathematicians start talking :) just knowing the terminology helps significantly.

But the most amazing part for me is that I was unknowingly learning more advanced mathematical concepts whilst reaching myself to code, and at the same time failing basic math in school. Coding created a "why" for me, solving problems for the sake of it at school isn't a big motivator.

**This is a long, heavy, hands-on read, I will change this document as I go.**
