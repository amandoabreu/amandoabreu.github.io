The differences between a company that can scale from one that can't are smaller than you think, you just need to properly use your resources and have good processes.

Some of these processes are obvious, others not so much.

How do your teams interact with each other? **Bad team relationships** will mean that your employees have very different visions for the future, which causes a **lack of alignment** and everyone is rowing the boat in a different direction.

It's very important for teams to interact, if everyone is working in silos nobody shares their points of view, and you can miss out on very good ideas.
**everyone** in your company has the potential to come up with **the next big idea**.
