WordPress is a popular *blogging* platform, according to Wordpress.org, 27% of the web uses WordPress.

Blogging was in italics because it's not very clear what WordPress wants to be, out of the box it's nothing but a blogging tool, but after expanding with plugins, it becomes a very powerful tool for more complex websites.

But there are no standard ways of doing things, so it very easily becomes very complicated, slow, and impossible to use.
