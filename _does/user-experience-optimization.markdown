Users expect a good experience on your site, and it's your responsibility they get to perform the comversions you want, this can only be done by optimizing the flow of users.

Many factors come into play when talking about user experience.

### Site speed

The world moves fast, people like to get their coffee fast, and people like to get to to work fast. Just like people like and expect fast sites.

Is your site fast? Does it load in 2 seconds or less?

Studies have shown that site speed is a major influencer on iser's perceived trust of a website, and is also directly related to conversions, put simply: The faster the site, the more conversions you're likely to get.


Let's say you net 12,000€ per month, and your site's pages load on average in 5 seconds, I decrease the load time by 50%, and increase your sales by a very realistic 5%, that is 600€, my work pays for itself in the first month, and then the following months you net more than you did before my work was done.
