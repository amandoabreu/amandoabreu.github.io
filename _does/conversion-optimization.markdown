As an internet business, it's your goal to turn visitors into customers, however, a high conversion rate is hard to come by, especially when your site isn't as optimized as it could be.

### What is a high conversion rate?

3%

## Make your users have the best experience possible

Users expect a good experience on your site, and it's your responsibility they get to perform the conversions you want in an easy and straightforward way, this can only be done by optimizing your website to be as fast as possible, have a good flow, and be accessible to users with disabilities as minor as bad eyesight.

Many factors come into play when talking about user experience.

### Site speed

The world moves fast, people like to get their coffee fast, and people like to get to to work fast. Just like people like and expect fast sites.

Is your site fast? Does it load in 2 seconds or less? What about on mobile phones with slow 3g internet connections?

Studies have shown that site speed is a major influencer on user's perceived trust of a website, and is also directly related to conversions, simply put: The faster the site, the more conversions you're likely to get.

### Usability

If your site is fast, you may still have usability issues.

Is your site optimized for users on mobile devices? Are they able to click on the things they want without having to zoom in on the page?


### Accessibility

<blockquote class="quote quote--left">
    "In Europe there are 2,550,000 blind people and 23,800,000 low vision people, giving a total of 26,350,000 visually impaired individuals."

This is often ignored by many, but I believe it's a moral obligation to allow people with disabilities as small as poor eyesight to properly use your website to receive the services/goods you provide and they want.
It's easy to say it's not significant, but an average of 1 in 30 Europeans experience sight loss, giving a total of over 26 million visually impaired people in Europe alone, does it seem prudent to automatically dismiss over 26 million possible clients?


[//]: # ### Cost


[//]: # Let's say you net 24,000€ per month, and your site's pages load on average in 8 seconds, I decrease the load time by 50%, and increase your sales by a very realistic 5%, that is
[//]: # 1200€, my work pays for itself in the first month, and then the following months you net more than you did before my work was done.
