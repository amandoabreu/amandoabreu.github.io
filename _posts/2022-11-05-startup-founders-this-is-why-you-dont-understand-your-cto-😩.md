Ok so you're C-level at a tech startup. Cool! ðŸš€ 

However, you are always butting heads with your technical people (perhaps even your CTO! You thought he was one of you but he's acting just like those damn consultants you had at one point! ðŸ˜¤)

But let's go back a bit.

You're founding a tech startup but you're non-technical. Hmm. This **could** be an issue, but it's an easily fixable one. Keep reading to hear some hot tips.

# Ok, you don't understand tech

As a "non-techy" you don't understand how tech works. This is OK. Your job isn't to understand it. It's to manage those who do. But if you wanna be in a tech company, you need to understand some things about the nature of the work in order to successfully manage us & the very different work we do.

# nature of the work

# makers VS talkers
Not a judge of character. Makers are often bad talkers. Talkers are often bad makers. CTOs need to be above average at both. It's a hard thing to be/do.

# distractions & holding complex data in your head

If you, as a non-tech C-level join a 15 minute birthday party of a co-worker, getting back to work is trivial if most of what you're doing is talking to people. 

Imagine you're creating a complex company budget/expected hires/expected income/etc for the next 2 years. Imagine you get interrupted in the middle of doing that. **This is what it's like to write code. Every single day.** you need to keep many things in your head, and a distraction will force you to start from zero. However, take the complexity of that budget and multiply it by 100. This is now closer to what the complexity of code is like.

For someone programming, a 15-minute party like this will completely ruin at least half a day of work because of the mental effort required to get back to a productive mental space.
