I have seen this message were Facebook "gives" away ad credit.

The message is something like this: "We're giving you a €10 credit to reach more people with an advert like this.", and they display it under a post on one of my pages:

After clicking on "Use credit", I get taken to the normal Facebook ad prompt, and if I were to purchase this particular ad, I would be charged on my credit card, the credit that facebook promised me is not even mentioned here.

After some searching I found an answer from a helpdesk person saying the following:

When you receive the notification informing you that you have a coupon , this coupon will be applied to your account after you have spent the intended amount. You can claiam this coupon to your account within your Ads Manager. I have listed the steps below:
-  Go to your Ads Manager (Facebook.com/ads/manager)
-  Click the “Billing” tab
-  In the payment method section click “Edit Payment Method”
-  Once you have completed these steps your coupon should be displayed. Click "Claim Coupon"

However, this is not what this says, is it?

There is no transparency at all in this, and it's very easy to finish the purchase without realizing that facebook did *not* in fact give you any credit.

Have you fallen victim of this? How did you proceed?
