You probably tried paying for something with your card, and it gets declined with the following error "\[OR-CCSEH-26]".

This is frustrating.

# Why error \[OR-CCSEH-26] happens 

This error happens because your bank forces 2-factor authentication (2FA) to make payments.

And google isn’t following your bank’s requirements. This is google’s fault.

# How to fix error \[OR-CCSEH-26] 

## Paypal

The known fixes right now include using [paypal](https://paypal.com/) to make the payment.

## Tired of google?

Alternatively, if you’re tired of google being google, I would heavily recommend switching to [Zoho](https://bit.ly/go-to-zoho-crm), they offer the same as google, at a very competitive price. Check them out!
