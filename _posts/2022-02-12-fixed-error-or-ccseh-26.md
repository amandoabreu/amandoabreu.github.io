You probably tried paying for something with your card, and it gets declined with the following error "\[OR-CCSEH-26]".

This is frustrating.

# Why error \[OR-CCSEH-26] happens 

This error happens because your bank forces 2-factor authentication (2FA) to make payments.

And google isn’t following your bank’s requirements. This is google’s fault.

## Wise.com virtual card

<a href="https://wise.prf.hn/click/camref:1011ltUt7" target="_blank">Wise.com</a> allows you to make a virtual card that works very well with google. This is the simplest solution, and the one I used personally.

## Alternatively, are you tired of google?

Alternatively, if you’re tired of google being google, I would heavily recommend switching to <a href="https://bit.ly/go-to-zoho-crm" target="_blank">Zoho</a>, they offer the same as google, at a very competitive price. (and your payments will work!) Check them out!
