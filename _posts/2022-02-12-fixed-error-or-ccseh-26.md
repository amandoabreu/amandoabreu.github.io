# Context of OR-CCSEH-26
You probably tried doing one of the following:
- Tried paying for google services with your card
- Tried changing cards in google workspace

And it gets declined with the following error: "Your card's issuer declined this request. Contact your bank or use a different payment method." 

And it's usually followed by the error code: "OR-CCSEH-26".

This is frustrating, and if you don't pay, **your services might be suspended**. I experienced exactly this when trying to replace a card on google workspace when my COO left my company and we needed to exchange her card with someone else's.

# Why error OR-CCSEH-26 happens 

This error happens because your bank forces 2-factor authentication (2FA) to make payments and for other requests.

In the case of switching cards on google workspace, it seems like the first time you add a card to google workspace, it uses 2FA, but when you add a new card, it skips that step for some reasons.

Long sotry short, google isn’t following your bank’s requirements. **This is google’s fault.**

Even if you contact your bank and ask why it's happening, you won't resolve it, because the bank is doing everything right.

# How to fix error OR-CCSEH-26

You have a few options that may or may not be available in your country. The last one is available for everyone, if the others fail.

## 1) Get a card that doesn't need 2FA
It may be possible for you to get a card that doesn't need 2FA. But most countries make this harder and harder.

## 2) Borrow someone's card temporarily 
This works but is not very popular. If you are able to get a hold of soneone else's card just until you resolve it through other means, this is a great choice.

## 3) Wise.com virtual card
If the other solutions fail, I would recommend a wise.com virtual card. This card offers other benefits such as streamlined cost management and enhanced security by acting as an entirely separate card. <a href="https://wise.prf.hn/click/camref:1011ltUt7" target="_blank">Wise.com</a> integrates seamlessly with Google. This was the most straightforward solution that I personally employed.
