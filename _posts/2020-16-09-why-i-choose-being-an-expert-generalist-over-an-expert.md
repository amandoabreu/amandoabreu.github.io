## Connecting dots and borrowing different ways of thinking

Different fields have different ways of thinking and common logical/mental tools. A well-rounded individual, needs to know these in order to understand the world as best as possible. Notice that I'm not talking about knowing hard facts that may or may not change, I'm talking about ways of thinking that are compatible with anything. It's not about knowing everything, but it is possible to have the tools to theoretically be able to find out anything. This is powerful.



## Expert society

Society is heading more and more towards expertise in deeper and deeper pieces of extremely complex systems. How does an expert generalist fit into this?

Experts aren't always the best communicators and can't always move in and out of different levels of abstraction. An expert generalist managing diverse experts is the glue that keeps all the highly specific parts of the train moving together as a single entity instead of breaking apart after a minor hitch.

## Problems with experts

Another problem that may arise from experts is that they are less likely to openly change themselves or to take seriously anything that threatens them. An expert at building landing pages maybe become threatened by a new AI technology that threatens to replace him or her. And this AI technology might be much better for the business, but the expert doesn't want to change.
