Customer: Is my engine fixed yet?

Mechanic: Yes

C: Great, then I'm gonna drive home

M: The engine is fixed, but it's still not back in the car

C: But you said it was done

M: Yeah, but not "done done"


Raise your hand if you've had similar interaction when working in tech. (but usually with a feedback loop of days or weeks).

What often follows is an argument of what "done" means. Note that I said \*argument\*, not discussion, and not a collaborative effort into agreeing upon what terms to use when.

It doesn't matter if you think \*done\* means X and someone else thinks \*done\* means Y. Your organization will need to have a definition of this and other terms.

## If you're asking questions

The questions need to be good. Above, when asked by the customer whether the engine was fixed, it's perfectly correct to say yes. Because the engine is indeed fixed. But the engine is a part in a complex system and it being fixed doesn't necessarily mean it's working together with the rest. Much like software.


The customer shouldn't have asked whether the engine was fixed if he wanted to know whether he could drive the car home. The question to avoid all that miscommunication would have been "can I drive the car home yet?".


If you're the one asking questions. Ask what you want to know. Instead of asking questions that give you information you don't really know what to do with. It's one of those cases of "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing". Don't be afraid to sound "dumb" by asking overly simple questions.

## If you're answering questions

Don't take any questions at face value. It's usually obvious what answer the person asking is looking for. In the mechanic example above, a more experience mechanic might have answered "the engine is fixed but we still have to put it back into the car", or even just "no" because the engine might be fixed now, but other issues might be found when putting it back into the car.
