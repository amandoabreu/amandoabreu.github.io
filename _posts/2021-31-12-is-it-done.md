Customer: Is my engine done yet?

Mechanic: Yes

C: Great, then I'm gonna drive home

M: The engine is done, but it's still not back in the car

C: But you said it was done

M: Yeah, but not "done done"

Raise your hand if you've had similar interaction when working in tech. (but usually with a feedback loop of days or weeks, and maybe some awkward situations with customers or investors).

What often follows is an argument of what "done" means. But that's usually not fruitful because the issue is something else. You can have the absolute bestest definition of "done" but if you use it wrong it matters not.

Maybe it doesn't matter what *done* means if you're asking the right questions. Let's see:

## If you're asking questions

The questions need to be good. Above, when asked by the customer whether the engine was done, it's perfectly correct to say yes. Because the engine is indeed done. But the engine is a part in a complex system and it being done doesn't necessarily mean it's working together with the rest. Much like software.

The customer shouldn't have asked whether the engine was done if he wanted to know whether he could drive the car home. The question to avoid all that miscommunication would have been "can I drive the car home yet?".

If you're the one asking questions. *Ask what you want to know.* 

Instead of asking questions that give you information you don't really know what to do with. It's one of those cases of "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing". 

Don't be afraid to sound "dumb" by asking overly simple questions if they are *exactly* what you want to know.

If you want to know whether something is ready to demo to a customer. Ask:

> Is this ready to demo to a customer?

Don't ask if it's "done". 

## If you're answering questions

Don't take any questions at face value. It's usually obvious what answer the person asking is looking for when you have enough experience. 

But "mindreading" is a fragile thing to depend on. If the people asking questions and making requests aren't able to do their jobs, then it's also not up to you to fix a dysfunctional organization (unless you're paid well for it). 

In the mechanic example above, a more experience mechanic might have answered "the engine is fixed but we still have to put it back into the car", or even just a very conservative "no" because the engine might be fixed now, but other issues might be found when putting it back into the car. The thing with hearing "no" very often when something isn't done, is that then the complaint will be that things take too long to get done. 


So, maybe. If you're having meetings to discuss the definition of "done" you're just not asking the right questions and expect a definition of a word to magically solve the issue.
