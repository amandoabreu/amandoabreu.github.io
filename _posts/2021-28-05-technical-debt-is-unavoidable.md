A product with no technical debt is going to miss the market timing by years.

Have you ever purchased a product that got recalled? That was due to technical debt. Do you know who took some of the risk of that technical debt? You.\

But what exactly is technical debt?\

Wikipedia says:

> "Technical debt (also known as design debt\[1] or code debt, but can be also related to other technical endeavors) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer."

And the thing is, all choices are made with incomplete data, and something now may not necessarily *look* like technical debt but become so with new information.
