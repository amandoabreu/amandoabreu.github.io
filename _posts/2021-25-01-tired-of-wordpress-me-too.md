# WordPress Lies

WordPress is full of lies and myths that I will now explain.



## Cheap Developers

Cheap developers will get you cheap development. And generally, I'd choose no development over cheap development. The price of complexity is very high, and the worse the dev, the more complex they make something that can be simple.

If you go on fiverr to get a developer, you will get someone who doesn't know certain basics. 

This is from someone with many five star ratings that is unable to use the standard method of logging into a server. This means they would be using less secure methods that are more error prone and open to attacks.

## Ego Design

I'm gonna tell you a little secret.

Your clients don't really give a shit about your design and how customized it is. What matters most is speed, content, and how easy it is to find it. You probably have an app to send them to anyway. Focus more on the app.

You might *want* to have a super-duper custom cool design, but you don't *need* it. Spend more time on what matters instead of this.
