Someone’s ideals will always be incompatible with other people's. Any time something is chosen instead of something else, you are essentially oppressing someone. Someone's oppression is another person's ideology.

Even in a perfectly democratic society, tyranny of the majority will still take place.

In a society with absolute freedom, there is still the tyranny of freedom. People who make bad choices are oppressed by having to make choices, whereas people who make good choices enjoy it.

We all want tyranny. As long as it’s the tyranny we agree with.
