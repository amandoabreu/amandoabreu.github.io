Coursera is an online platform that allows you to study and get certified on a variety of topics. It's what's called a "MOOC" or Massive Open Online Courses platform.

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of certifications because the emphasis is removed from the content and the actual learning material, and instead is placed on a piece of paper of imaginary value. In school, one of the things I hated the most was the unethical cheating on tests, and seeing people incapable of actually doing the work getting decent grades. It's lying, and lying is bullshit. Those grades are often used by employers and influence choices that may affect one's entire life. For some things like maths and computer science, it's easy to catch who cheated because the feedback-loop is incredibly short, but for softer subjects with results that are harder to measure? This is dangerous, because many will end up in business and politics.

Cheating is an important skill to have, don't get me wrong. It takes intelligence to cheat properly, but if the systems are easy to cheat, anyone can do it. The solution? Make it harder to cheat, you filter out the dumber cheaters :D

But there's still a problem. What if cheating IS hard, but some of the smarter cheaters simply charge money to cheat for the dumber cheaters? That's what we're going to investigate today.

# Fake Verifiable Coursera Certificates

I like a good security vulnerability as much as the next guy, so I got curious. Is this due to a vulnerability? If so, I'm gonna try to get the guy to fess up, and then I'll simply report it to coursera and my good deed for the day is done.

I add him on skype.

Me: "Hey, I'm here for the coursera certificates"

Him: "Hey. Yes. I can give you all the premium courses, Google IT, CIRCO Networking, Python, etc"

Me: "Can I get an example to see if it's verifiable?"

Him:

I check this guy's Linkedin Profile, lo-and behold:

They might need to do a better job, and AFAIK they are making some courses harder to cheat than others.

The importance of a certificate is inversely proportional to the ease of cheating on it.

So, is education about the results, or is it a filter for those who can afford it? If we make education free and/or incredibly cheap, then what exactly what are filtering?

The current education paradigm has many flaws, but that's because it's super complicated. How many people do you know that spent a lot of money and time on their education to end up doing something completely different?

Another problem is that it's incredibly hard to test people. Asking them to regurgitate what they read doesn't mean they learned anything. Perhaps we should move the focus from teaching "stuff" to teaching people how to find what they actually want to do. What if we gave kids academic freedom much earlier? 

And who uses certificates to check if someone is educated? Probably someone that can't test the people they hire. They're trusting that the same universities their taxes paid for did a good job.
