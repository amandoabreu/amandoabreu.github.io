Than's an interesting one though I'm totally against AI content as it's super unethical and wrong in many ways.
Ask yourself, would you like to see all Google results being auto-generated content? Then the whole internet would be useless and filled with garbage.
No point in searching for information or anything anymore if AI takes over the results.

Anyways, good luck with this OP, following closely.
