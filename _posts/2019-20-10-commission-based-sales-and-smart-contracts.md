Comission-bases salesmen will sooner or later feel robbed by their employers. And in some settings, getting paid or not depends entirely on the integrity of the employer. Since the employer isn't a single entity but instead a group of individuals acting for their own best interests, it's easy for a salesman down in the chain of command to get screwed over from commissions.

Let's say a compensation structure involves recurring comissions from future sales, it's impossible for the salesman to keep track of future purchases from his successful lead as the future sales are usually managed by an account manager or customer success manager.

So, what? Are they bound to just jump ship every 2 years and get screwed over from missing commissions? Perhaps the business doesn't suffer from this, and in the eyes of the business it's OK.

How could smart contracts solve this issue in the perspective of the salesman?

First of all, what's a smart contract?

## Smart contract

> Smart contracts are self-executing, business automation applications that run on a decentralized network such as blockchain.
>
> And because they're able to remove administrative overhead, smart contracts are one of most attractive features associated with blockchain technology. While blockchain acts as a database, confirming that transactions have taken place, smart contracts execute pre-determined conditions; think about a smart contract as a computer executing on "if/then," or conditional, programming.

So to simplify, imagine that the lead you bring in signs a smart contract with the company you work for and becomes a client. And that contract includes exactly your commission for the first sale and future sales for X years. Every time the client pays via that contract, you get your commission without it ever being at the discretion of another person that may decide to whithhold your payment. Cool, right? The company could decide to just make a new contract in which you don't exist, but it's easier to know when that is done than to have no transparency at all.
