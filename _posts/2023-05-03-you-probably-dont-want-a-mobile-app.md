Mobile app development used to be a surefire way to achieve financial success, but those days are gone. With over 2.7 million applications available on Google Play alone, it's become nearly impossible to stand out in the crowded app marketplace.

In fact, AppBrain stats reveal that a staggering 2.2 million apps on Google Play have less than three ratings. This means that even the developers themselves have not downloaded the app or bothered to rate it. It's a ghost town out there.

So why would anyone bother creating a native app for Android or iOS when a Progressive Web App (PWA) can do almost everything that a native app can do? PWAs don't require users to download and install an app, pay royalties on sales, or deal with the hassle of app store regulations.

PWAs are "instantly there," as they can be accessed through a browser without the need to download a bloated 50MB app. Even game developers can export for WebGL instead of building a native app. It's a no-brainer.

In conclusion, the days of building a mobile app for financial success are over. The competition is too fierce, and the rewards are too low. If you're considering building a mobile app, think twice and consider a PWA instead. You'll save time, money, and headaches in the long run.
