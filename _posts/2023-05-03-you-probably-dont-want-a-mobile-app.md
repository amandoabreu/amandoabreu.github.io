Mobile apps used to be cool and a reasonable way to get software into mobile devices. But:

* People are reluctant to install yet another app
* App stores have too much control over what you can publish
* App stores take too much of your in-app revenue

AppBrain stats reveal that a staggering 2.2 million apps on Google Play have less than three ratings. This means that even the developers themselves have not downloaded the app or bothered to rate it. It's a ghost town out there.

## What if there was a better way?

Well, there is.

It's a Progressive Web App (PWA)

PWAs are essentially websites that deliver app-like experiences.

Some quick facts:

* Installation is optional
* No royalties on sales
* Zero control from an app store saying you can or can't do

Here you can <a target="_blank" href="https://trailguide.no/news/why-not-native-app/" alt="pwa">read more</a> about why Bjørn from Trailguide decided to keep his product as a PWA.

One of the biggest reasons, especially for early stage businesses without a lot of cash to throw away:

> "Having one codebase: If we created Trailguide as a native app, we would need to have three codebases. One for iOS (Swift), one for Android (Java or Kotlin), and one for the Web (JavaScript). Having three codebases would require a lot more developer skills and resources, something we do not currently have." – Bjørn, Trailguide

A PWA is a single codebase for your mobile users and computer users. This is BIG during early stages!

PWAs are "instantly there," as they can be accessed through a browser without the need to download a bloated 50MB app. Even game developers can export for WebGL instead of building a native app. It's a no-brainer.

## "But can I put this on an app store?"

You can, but you don't have to.

## "Does it work offline?"

Yes! PWAs can be made "offline-first" just like a native app.

## Conclusion

Hope this made you consider a PWA!
