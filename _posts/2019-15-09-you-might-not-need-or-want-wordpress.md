In my time developing all sorts of web applications I've run into WordPress many times. It's a fine platform for some things, but it comes with a lot of "bullshit" that most business owners would probably like to avoid if they knew about it. There are many myths as to why WP is "good for small businesses" but I don't agree with the majority, and think the absolute opposite is actually true.

This isn't a piece about coding style or software, it's purely about the experience of owning a WordPress site in a rapid changing business environment and how it often creates more harm than good. I also have solutions on how to minize the damage once it's done, but people usually pay to hear those as they are very project specific.

# Myth 1: "the famous 5-minute install"

One time I met a guy who thinks he's funny(and he is). Our first interaction went like this:

**Guy:** I'm very quick at maths

**Me:** Ok

**Guy:** Try me

**Me:** What is 2346434*43242?

**Guy:** 56

**Me:** That's wrong

**Guy:** yeah but it was quick

# Myth 2: There are a lot of cheap "WordPress developers"

Ok you got me, this one isn't a myth. But there are a lot of cheap vendors of anything out there, would you go to a $5 an hour dentist?

# Myth 3: "WordPress powers 25% of the internet, that means it's good"

99% of the internet is crap, so what point is this making exactly?

# Myth 4: "WordPress has thousands of developers working on security"

If you were to have your own application, you'd have one developer working on security. So what's wrong wit having literally thousads of developers contributing to the open source WP project?

The problem is that you also have tens of thousands of automated tools made specifically to exploit WordPress because it makes sense for malicious actors to automatically be able to scan 25% of the websites out there. It's fixeable, however, but the $5 an hour WordPress developer you hired doesn't really know how to.

# Myth 5: "Lots of free plugins"

Every free plugin you install turns your admin dashboard into ad space for the premium version of the plugin that happens to come with the feature you actually need. Most free plugins are very limited, and once you factor in the paid versions of what you need, your site ends up costing 10x your budget. Not to mention that eventually you want a custom tool and end up daisy-chaining 12 plugins to accomplish something that a decent developer could conjure up in 30 minutes.
