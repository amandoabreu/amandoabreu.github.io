A general heuristic I have is to be suspicious of marketers who pretend to be doers of something other than marketing. These people are so good at selling that they can accidentally sell shit and the market happily buys it, if the customer is happy, then, they were successful, even if they sold them worthless shit. 

I don't know if they're aware of it sometimes, but then again, if I were paid $50k to draw some circles on a board I'd also probably not question it.\

This is not an article shitting on Simon, merely a meta-analysis of articles that explain the shortcomings and blatant falsehoods of what he's selling.
