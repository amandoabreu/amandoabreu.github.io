I﻿ run a course platform with the popular WP LMS called LearnPress. Before making this plugin, I could only accept payments via paypal, but this was costing me sales.\
\
L﻿earnPress has a Stripe integration as a plugin, but I wanted to make it myself, and I specifically wanted to use [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout)\
\
I﻿ asked chatGPT "make a LearnPress Add-on to allow stripe checkout payments"\
\
Things chatGPT is really good at:

* U﻿sing popular APIs 

T﻿his is something I noticed when using github copilot. You can nearly skip doc-reading if the use-case is a very common one (wouldn't recommend not reading docs, though!)
