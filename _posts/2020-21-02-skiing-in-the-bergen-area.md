# Locations and getting there:

There are 5 regions close to bergen for skiing in winter, and 1 location in Summer.

### Fløyen(Cross country/fjellski only)

**Getting there**

You take the gondola up to Fløyen as usual, and walk up the road until you reach the trails that were prepared. Sometimes you can ski right out of Fløyen, other times you have to walk up almost to Brushytten.

**Cost**

You can get a pitiful discount if you buy online: <!--StartFragment-->

Return ticket costs 95kr from the city centre to the top. If you buy in person it costs 100kr. It's cheaper if you take the gondola at Fjellveien, for example(useful if you live close by).

**Conditions**

**Notes**

After heavy snow it's quite often not possible to drive here without 4x4 because the roads aren't plowed as often as more important roads.

### Folgefonna glacier(Summer)

If you want to ski in summer, it's also possible. At the resort you can do downhill skiing and cross country, but at your own peril you're able to do whatever you want anywhere on the glacier, including staying over at a DNT cabin!



**Notes:**

Ulriken also has skiing conditions sometimes for mostly fjellski, randonee, or touring. Nothing is prepared, and I recommend going with someone that knows the area first to avoid some dangers.

Going by car can be affected by weather(avalanches, ice) and traffic, so if you go during a weekend with good conditions(sunny, no wind, good snow) I recommend taking the train or you're pretty much guaranteed to be in traffic for a while. If you live outside the sentrum, you can drive to Arna train station and go from there.
