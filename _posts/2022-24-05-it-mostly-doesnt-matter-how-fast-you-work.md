TL;DR; 

1. Others will slow you down
2. Society rewards consistency, not necessarily speed
3. In order to use your speed you need to first prove yourself via consistency 
4. Most complex challenges are marathons

I'm gonna start off this post with an analogous story related to a mountain bike race I did in 2013.\
\
The race format is as follows:

1. You have a certain amount of time to ride up 4 different hills

   1. This part isn't timed, but you have a cut-off time where you get disqualified if you take too long to reach the top
2. You race down each hill 

   1. Each rider is sent down the hill with a 30 second interval from each other
   2. The times of each race are added up
   3. The person with the fastest combined downhill times wins

I made a drawing to help explain better:

Most people had bikes built especially for this format of racing. My bike was built just for going down. Climbing this bike was quite some effort, but it was the only bike I had and I figured I'd be able to go downhill faster than people on smaller bikes.

By now you might be thinking that the story is about being consistent in each race instead of being fast in one and slow on the others. And although that would make a good story, it's actually not what this is about.\
\
You see. 

Races like these have different classes of riders. 

Riders earn "points" with top positions in each race, and the consistently faster people are put in an "elite" class and are allowed to go down first in each race. 

This means a few things, but one very important one pops out:\
\
They don't run the risk of having someone significantly slower than them being in their way.

Riders who don't race often are put in a "general" category and are sent down the hill randomly. The person in front can either be very fast or very slow.

And this was exactly my problem. You see, the trails we race down are what is called "single track". They look like this:

Which makes it essentially impossible to overtake. If you catch up to a slower rider in front of you and they don't have a spot to get out of the way, you are stuck at their speed. And this is what happened to me.\
\
I caught up with a slower rider pretty quickly because he was significantly slower than me. And I was stuck behind him for a considerable amount of time. 

I finally overtook him when the terrain allowed, and not long after I caught up with ANOTHER rider that was also very slow and was stuck behind him for a while.
