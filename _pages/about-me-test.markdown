I've been a CTO at DigitalXBO, an Obos spin-off, and a co-founded <a href="https://perlo.io" target="_blank">Perlo.io</a>.

I've done fractional CTO work for multiple startups in all sorts of verticals worldwide.

Experience in several industries, most notably e-commerce, SaaS, media, travel, insurance, property development, and construction.

Although I'm a tech guy (the how), I don't limit myself to only tech, having quite broad experience building products with customers answering *the what* and *the why*. 

I like how the internet works and have first-hand experience with e-commerce, SEO, paid ads, and social media marketing.
