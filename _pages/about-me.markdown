## My motivation to write

Ever since I was young, I discovered that I'm good at picking up patterns. So, I spent a lot of time trying to pick up more patterns, and even patterns of the patterns.

When I pick up some patterns, I like to make a rough outline of them and systematically apply them to things other than where I discovered them. Sometimes the results are insanely dumb, other times insanely precise. I'm aware of this, and diligently test the theoretical results against the real world.(if you catch me in a test phase, I'm actively thinking out loud, and you will think I'm an asshole).

I will share some patterns I see in the world in this site as a reference for myself and others.

## Why I got here

During my career as an engineer, I found myself either with incredibly different thoughts than my peers, or working between upper management and engineering. This forced me to juggle completely different points-of-view, goals, problems, and ideas. I had to conciliate both sides and make it possible for both sides to communicate more clearly and avoid misunderstandings. All for the sake of the project and the business.

Upper-management was always incredibly big picture oriented, naturally. And engineers were mostly detail oriented.

The funny phenomenon that will now seem very obvious, is that upper-management tended to assumed the details would sort themselves out(or else). And engineers tended to assume the big picture would sort itself. Both sides assumed and hoped the other side knew better, failing to realize that the failure to communicate these assumptions would be the cause of all the problems every business will always have.

This lead me on a search for how to better understand humans, and is arguably my favourite thing to do.

I don't associate with a single job title or label, which makes it incredibly hard to explain what I do, the idea of this site is to showcase a little of how I think in order to not have to explain myself with spoken words as often as I feel forced to.

A lot of people find me incredibly pretentious due to my idiosyncrasies. I'm aware that I might come off like that sometimes. The thing is, I just don't care that much about it(but definitely enough to write all this, so make up your own mind with how you feel about this situation).
