# A little about my history:

During my career as an engineer, I found myself either with incredibly different thoughts than my peers, or working between upper management and engineering. This forced me to juggle completely different points-of-view, goals, problems, and ideas. I had to conciliate both sides and make it possible for both sides to communicate more clearly and avoid misunderstandings. All for the sake of the project and the business.

Upper-management was always incredibly big picture oriented, naturally. And engineers were mostly detail oriented.

## Where this goes wrong in organizations

The funny phenomenon that will now seem very obvious, is that upper-management tended to assume the details would sort themselves out(or else). And engineers tended to assume the big picture would also sort itself out. Both sides assumed and hoped the other side knew better, failing to realize that the failure to communicate these assumptions would be the cause of all the problems every organization will always have. Nearly every single tool your business uses internally is an attempt at making similar knowledge transfer processes easier(either between upper management and engineers, or upper-management and finance, upper-management and sales, etc). Unless you're in the top 1% of businesses(think google, amazon, facebook, etc), bad tools will lead to worse work comparatively to others with slightly better tools. This makes you less competitive.

This lead me on a search for how to better understand humans to improve collaboration, and is arguably my favourite thing to do.

But, since I also understand machines fairly well, and that most businesses nowadays are <a href="https://scholar.google.no/scholar?q=complex+cybernetic+systems&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart" target="_BLANK">complex cybernetic systems</a>(computers and humans working together), I'm able to make sense of a lot of extremely different information and simplify it to make chasing a goal easier and faster for everyone involved.

> I like to get the right people and the right tools working together to transform sub-par systems into highly effective machines, but taking into account personal and technological limitations.

I won't expect people to work like machines, and I won't expect machines to work like people.

I don't associate with a single job title or label, which makes it incredibly hard to explain what I do, the idea of this site is to showcase a little of how I think in order to not have to explain myself with spoken words as often as I feel forced to.

A lot of people find me incredibly pretentious due to my idiosyncrasies. I'm aware that I might come off like that sometimes. The thing is, I just don't care that much about it(but definitely enough to write all this, so make up your own mind about how you feel about this).

## My motivation to write

Ever since I was young, I discovered that I'm good at picking up patterns. So, I spent a lot of time trying to pick up more patterns, and even patterns of the patterns. If I figure out how something works, I proceed to document my findings, and move onto something else.

When I pick up some patterns, I like to make a rough outline of them and systematically apply them to things other than where I discovered them. Sometimes the results are insanely dumb, other times insanely precise. I'm aware of this, and diligently test the theoretical results against the real world.(if you catch me in a test phase, I'm actively thinking out loud, and you will think I'm an asshole).

I will share some patterns I see in the world in this site as a reference for myself and others.

## Who I write for

My only expectation from readers is that they're reasonable according to the standard of the culture we share. My favourite method of persuasion for most people is the Ethos. As I find Logos to get too complicated very quickly in complex systems, and I find Pathos to be manipulative.

My biggest weakness is failing to provide sources that validate my opinions a bit better, but to be fair, sometimes the sources don't exist(yet).
