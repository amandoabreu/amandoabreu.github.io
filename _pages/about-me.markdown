1) Hate writing about myself

2) Nonlinear/divergent thinker 

3) Into electronics(with passive components) since age 9

4) Self-taught how to code(C for microcontrollers) at age 14(6 months after getting my first computer and using the internet) 

5) Extremely intrinsically motivated towards making things

6) Can hyperfocus on a single topic for years if the occasion requires it

7) Somewhat blind to external stimuli 

8) Think very slowly but usually very accurately(I like to sleep on important/complex decisions)

9) Extremely solution oriented and it sometimes makes me come off as asocial even though the solution I'm oriented towards is 100% for prosocial reasons

10) Love to look at things from very different points of view and modes of thinking

11) Change my opinion based on new information

12) Have a deep need to learn new things

13) Love to challenge myself in different ways

14) Read a lot 

15) I don't fight uphill battles. If something fails a quantitative effort/reward analysis, I won't do it. However, as point 6) suggests, the reward I value most is sometimes something hard to grasp from the outside. eg: I'd take a 30% pay cut in exchange for more autonomy.

16) No patience for corporate dogmas that punish everyone for a mistake someone did in a distant past
