Hey! My background is deeply technical, but throughout the years it came to my attention that projects rarely fail due to technical issues. 

In fact, most of the time it's a business issue!

So, as time went by and I founded my own projects, I honed my product skills to deliver more value instead of just delivering code.

I love building things, and I'm pretty good at the strategy part *before* building anything. Such as finding out what to build when, why, and for whom. This makes anything I build extremely surgical and precise, without waste.

I've seen just about every mistake one can make when launching a software project, and I'm pretty good at detecting wrong directions.

It's inherently very hard to predict success, but it's super easy to predict and avoid total failure.
