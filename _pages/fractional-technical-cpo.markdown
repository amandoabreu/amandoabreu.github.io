Hey! My background is deeply technical, but throughout the years it came to my attention that **projects rarely fail due to technical issues**. 

In fact, most of the time it's a **business issue**!

So, as time went by and I founded my own projects, I honed my product skills to deliver more value instead of just delivering code.

The only thing I love more than building things is building **things people actually use**.

So, I've become pretty good at the strategy part **before** building anything. Such as finding out exactly **what** to build **when**, **why**, and for **whom**. This makes anything I build extremely surgical and precise, without waste, with a much shorter time-to-market.

I've seen just about every mistake one can make when launching a software project, and I'm pretty good at detecting wrong directions.

It's inherently very hard to predict success, but it's super easy to predict and avoid total failure. (which is still 90%+ of startups!)

Consider me a deeply technical product person that can build just about anything, yet still have very high-level discussions with C-level and investors.

I'd love to hear about your project. Let's talk!
