# Affiliate Disclosure - amandoabreu.com

On my website, I will occasionally evaluate or mention products and services. If I believe a product or service is good, and the merchant selling it provides an affiliate programme, I have no problem referring others to it via an affiliate link, which means I may receive a commission or other kind of income if you purchase the product I promote.

Certain items and links to products/services are affiliate links, and any purchases you make may result in a commission for me. I am paid to give my honest opinion on products and/or services on occasion. You will not be charged any additional fees as a result of this.

These items and services are mentioned because I believe in them and wish to assist you in improving your life. I only endorse products or services that I believe will benefit you. Of course, full disclosure: Making Sense of Cents is a for-profit business, which means I do make money from it.

To make things easier for both of us, assume that any links to products or services are affiliate links and that I will be compensated if you buy something. Our disclosure page is created with the help of blogearns' Affiliate disclosure generator.

Affiliate links are disclosed in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's standards.
