hello: "Hey there!"

After leaving trivago after our IPO in 2017, and decided to start consulting for businesses.

I apply techniques learned working in a highly efficient company that generates over 600M€ per year to your business so you can produce 100 times more results without doing more work. Get on touch: <a href="https://remotivate.io/">Remotivate</a>.

Currently spend a lot of time at remotivate with internal and external projects, and live in Düsseldorf, Germany.

Here are some projects I've [done](https://amando-abr.eu/did), you can see more on [codepen](http://codepen.io/amando96/){:target="_blank"} and [github](https://github.com/amandoabreu){:target="_blank"}.
