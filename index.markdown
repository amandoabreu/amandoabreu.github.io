“Ordinarily he was insane, but he had lucid moments when he was merely stupid." —Heinrich Heine

I'm a philosopher at heart but have been working officially as an engineer for 10 years and unofficially for 20. I spend a lot of time thinking about the future of society and how to improve collaboration in complex cybernetic systems. Here I dump all my writing without any particular order and about any topic that I happen to take an interest to.
