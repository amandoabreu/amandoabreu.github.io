hello: "Hey there!"

I'm a self-taught Web Designer and Developer, my first contact with programming was with hardware in C and Assembly for my robotics projects, and later moved onto Web and Mobile App Development.

I started doing freelance work in 2010 and since then I've worked in-house for Rightcolors, Worklovers, Niobo, and Portugal Telecom.

I currently work at trivago and live in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
