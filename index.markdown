hello: "Hey there!"

I started with robotics at age 9, and taught myself how to write code at age 14.

Took my first freelance client at age 17, and 9 years later I've worked for big multinationals, lead teams, and managed projects.

After leaving trivago after their IPO in 2017, I founded <a href="https://remotivate.io/">Remotivate</a>.

We multiply your results by a factor of 100 by optimizing personal and technical resources.

My extremely wide range of skills allows me to put any project out faster and better than you can imagine, helping you create tremendous long-term value and avoid common pitfalls to waste money and time on. <a href="https://remotivate.io/">Get in touch</a>.

Currently in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
