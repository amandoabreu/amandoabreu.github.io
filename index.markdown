hello: "Hey there!"
---

I'm a self-taught Web Developer, my first contact with programming was with C and Assembly for my robotics projects, and later moved onto Web and Mobile App Development.

I like making pretty and fast user interfaces, but I also like manipulating data.

I currently work [@trivago](https://www.facebook.com/lifeattrivago/?fref=ts) and live in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

Here is some stuff I've [done](https://amando-abr.eu/did).

You can reach me via email: amando.abreu@gmail.com.
