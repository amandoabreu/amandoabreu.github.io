hello: "Hey there!"

I'm a self-taught Web Developer, my first contact with programming was with C and Assembly for my robotics projects, and later moved onto Web and Mobile App Development.

I like making pretty and fast user interfaces, but I also like manipulating data and mountain biking.

I currently work [@trivago](https://www.facebook.com/lifeattrivago/?fref=ts){:target="_blank"} and live in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

Here are some projects I've [done](https://amando-abr.eu/did), you can see more on [codepen](http://codepen.io/amando96/){:target="_blank"} and [github](https://github.com/amandoabreu){:target="_blank"}.

Here's my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandoabreu/){:target="_blank"}.

You can reach me via email: amando.abreu@gmail.com.
