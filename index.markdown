Started with robotics at age 9 and now I like to code for the web, manage teams, and help individuals acquire the skills they desire.

Currently spend some time @remotivate with internal and external projects, and live in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.

Here are some projects I've [done](https://amando-abr.eu/did), you can see more on [codepen](http://codepen.io/amando96/){:target="_blank"} and [github](https://github.com/amandoabreu){:target="_blank"}.

Here's my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandoabreu/){:target="_blank"}.
