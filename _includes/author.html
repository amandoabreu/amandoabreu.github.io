        <h2>Amando Abreu</h2>
        I'm a self-taught Web Developer, my first contact with programming was with C and Assembly for my robotics projects, and later moved onto Web and Mobile App Development.

        I like making pretty and fast user interfaces, but I also like manipulating data.

        I currently work <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lifeattrivago/?fref=ts" target="_BLANK">@trivago</a> and live in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
